An attempt at solving the issue of hotbar space, without making the hotbar bigger or adding more slots to the inventory.

The plan is as follows:
- Closing the inventory while holding an item in your cursor will put it temporarily in your hand.
  Opening an inventory will put it back in your cursor.
  Selecting a hotbar slot via numbers or scrolling will attempt to put it back in your inventory, as if you had just picked it up from the ground.
- You may use a keybind with the inventory closed to deselect the hotbar entirely, leaving your hand empty for interaction with things.
  Picking up a new item will put it in your hand, for convenient usage or disposal.
  Pressing the keybind a second time will temporarily empty your offhand as well, for things requiring both hands to be empty.
  Pressing it a third time, or selecting a hotbar slot, will resume holding your offhand item as normal. 
- You may use a keybind to select a slot of your main inventory to use from your hand.
  Scrolling will change which slot is selected, allowing usage of your entire inventory without any rearranging.
  Pressing a number will move the selection back to the hotbar, and scrolling will stay within the hotbar as normal.
